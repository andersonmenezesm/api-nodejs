# Node.js
## Application of Node.js and Backend Concepts
This repository consists of small solutions in Node.js. Used by me in other applications, which are the result of the challenges and practice of Botcamp GoStack classes (Rocketseat).

## Getting started:
To use this material (as a study or test), you can do it very simply. Make sure you have git installed, clone the repository and install the project's dependencies using yarn.
